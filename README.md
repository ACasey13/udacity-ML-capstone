My capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. It consists of the exploration, cleaning, and analysis of customer demographics data for a German mail-order sales company. The customer and general populations are segmented using Cramer's V test and k-modes clustering. Afterwards, individual responses to a mailout campaign are predicted using a gradient boosting model tuned with Bayesian optimization.
